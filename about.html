      <h1 class="about__title">about this journal</h1>

      <div class="about__body">
        <p>Daniel Kahneman kept a journal he called whatiwriteofwhatithink. I stumbled on this while preparing to teach &mdash; I was reading about his Nobel Prize, building a class on decision-making &mdash; and something in me went quiet. That&rsquo;s it, I thought. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been doing.</p>

        <p>I have been writing since before I knew why. A personal blog for the thoughts I almost tweeted. A business blog for the ideas I needed to argue out loud before I believed them. Essays nobody asked for, sent to nobody. Notes from classrooms and border crossings and one particular train ride home from Baden, Switzerland, where I cried for reasons I couldn&rsquo;t name until I started writing them down.</p>

        <p>For a long time, these lived in separate places &mdash; as if the person who writes about diminishing returns in regression models and the person who put her feet in the river in June and felt suddenly, violently alive are different people. They aren&rsquo;t.</p>

        <p>The only way I know how to process the world is to write it. This is where I do that. All of it.</p>

        <p class="about__coda">This blog consolidates writing from two previous homes &mdash; Things I Almost Tweeted (personal blog) and faridaadamu.com (professional writing) &mdash; along with essays and notes that never found a permanent place. Categories are: the eye, the world, market note, the machine, from here.</p>
