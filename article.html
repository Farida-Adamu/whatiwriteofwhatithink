        <p>There is something in the way a saxophone catches light. Not literally &mdash; but the way a note bends carries the same physics as refraction. I have been thinking about this since Tuesday, when I sat in a half-empty bar in the Marais and listened to a man play Coltrane as if he were arguing with someone who had already left the room.</p>

        <p>Jazz, when it is honest, does not perform. It processes. The musician is not showing you what they know &mdash; they are showing you what they are trying to understand. This is why it unsettles people who want music to behave. Jazz does not behave. It thinks out loud.</p>

        <p>I have always listened to music visually. A chord change is a colour shift. A rest is negative space. A bridge is literally a bridge &mdash; you can feel the architecture of it, the way it bears weight and transfers you from one place to another. This is not synesthesia. It is just attention.</p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>The ear is a second eye. Both are organs of pattern recognition. The difference is that the eye edits before you know it, and the ear lets everything in.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>I first understood this watching a documentary about Thelonious Monk. There is a moment where he stops playing mid-phrase, stands up from the piano, and turns in a slow circle. The other musicians keep going. When he sits back down, the phrase he plays is different from the one he left. Something happened in the silence &mdash; in the turning &mdash; that changed the sentence he was building.</p>

        <h2>The Geometry of Improvisation</h2>

        <p>Improvisation is not randomness. It is real-time architecture. The musician is constructing something with constraints &mdash; the key, the time signature, the chord changes, the expectations of the other players &mdash; and the art is in how those constraints get navigated, respected, subverted.</p>

        <p>This is why I find jazz more interesting to watch than to listen to in headphones. In headphones, you hear the result. In the room, you see the decisions. You see the bassist glance at the drummer a quarter-beat before a change. You see the pianist&rsquo;s left hand hesitate and then commit. You see the breath before the note.</p>

        <p>The breath before the note is where all the meaning lives.</p>

        <h2>What This Has to Do With Writing</h2>

        <p>Everything. Writing is improvisation with constraints. The sentence is the phrase. The paragraph is the solo. And the reader &mdash; if you are lucky &mdash; is the other musician, listening not just for what you say but for where you pause, where you speed up, where you choose the unexpected chord.</p>

        <p>I write the way I listen to jazz: with my eyes open. Looking for the colour in the sound. Waiting for the moment where the musician stops playing and starts turning in a slow circle, and the music somehow continues without them, and when they return, everything has changed.</p>

        <p>That bar in the Marais closes at midnight. I stayed until they turned the lights on. The saxophone player packed up his instrument with the kind of care you give to something that knows your secrets. I walked out into the Paris night, which is cold in the way that only Paris nights are cold &mdash; not bitter, just present &mdash; and I could still hear the last note bending.</p>

        <p>It was the colour of amber. I am sure of it.</p>
